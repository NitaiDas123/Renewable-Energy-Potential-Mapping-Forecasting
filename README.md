# Renewable-Energy-Potential-Mapping-Forecasting
This project analyzes a large renewable energy dataset (2500 rows, 56 columns) combining weather and spatial features to uncover patterns influencing energy generation. Using EDA, regression, forecasting, and geospatial mapping, it aims to predict future renewable potential and highlight optimal zones, supporting data-driven clean energy planning.
